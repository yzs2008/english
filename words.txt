solitary:单独的
A Java Virtual Machine instance starts running its solitary application by invoking the main() method of some initial class

depiction:描述
See Figure 5-3 for a graphical depiction of the memory areas the Java Virtual Machine creates for each thread.

primordial:原始的，最根本的
the Java Virtual Machine contains two kinds of class loaders: a primordial class loader and class loader objects

contiguous:连续的
The size of the method area need not be fixed. As the Java application runs, 
the virtual machine can expand and contract the method area to fit the applicationís needs. 
Also, the memory of the method area need not be contiguous. 
It could be allocated on a heap--even on the virtual machineís own heap

trample:践踏 伤害
There is no way two different Java applications could trample on each otherís heap data. 
Two different threads of the same application, however, could trample on each otherís heap data.
